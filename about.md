I am Archana Kalburgi, a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am pursuing masters in Computer science, specializing in Machine Learning.

I have currently invested my time in learning data structure and algorithms and how to tackle interview coding questions as I am looking for internship opportunities. You can find my learning related to the same in some of my blog posts. Hope you find them interesting.

If you have any suggestions or would like to get in touch with me please feel free to message me on my [Linkedin:](www.linkedin.com/in/archana-kalburgi)
