# For loop or While loop? 

- `for loop` is used when you know how many times you want to loop over something.
- the counter that keep keeps the track of number of times you have looped over something is incremented or decremented until a condition is met
- where as while loops behaves differently from for loop, although while loop is also used to loop over something
- while loops are used when you are not sure of how many time you want to loop over something
- a while loop run over a code over and over until a condition becomes  _false_ 
- where as if condition lets us run a block of code below it only if the condition is met


## An example to illustrate when do we use a while loop and when do use a for loop: 

### search a value 'X'  given a head of a linked list
- in this case we do not know the length the linked list we are just give a value that is present in the linked list and the head of the linked list
- you have loop over the linked list till you find 'X'
- using a while is easier in this case
```sh
while temp.val != 'X': 
    go to next node
```
- the block will loop over every value in the linked list till it finds 'X'.
- once temp.val == 'X' then while loop stops running the code below it.


### construct a linked list using a given array
- in this case you are given an array, you know how many time you have to loop over this array to construct a linked list, which would be equal to the length of the given array
- using a for loop in this case will be a wise decision
```sh
for i in array:
    construct a node with val=i 
    attach previous node to the current node 
```
